Identification and selection of these 5 experts/evaluators will be guided by local teams of urban observers available in a number of cities. During the pilot exercises, these urban observers, as local holders of urban data at the city level, are able to coordinate the evaluations and to verify the consequences and relevant local references, guiding the decisions and the scores of the evaluators.<br>  To measure and test the existence of some structures of participation of civil society in urban governance and management, the Likert questionnaire will be used with a scale of 4 points (do not agree at all, do not agree, agree, and fully agree). These structures will be reviewed via four basic elements which were assessed within pilot exercises, as follows:<br>  1. Are there structures for civil society to participate in urban planning, including designs and agreements, in a direct, regular and democratic way?<br>  2. Are there structures for civil society to participate in decision-making about local urban budget in a direct, regular and democratic way?<br>  3. Are there structures for civil society assessment and reaction regarding urban management performance, which would be in a direct, regular and democratic way?<br>  4. Are these structures promoting participation of women, men and young people and/or other marginalized groups?<br>  Once all the above elements are assessed by one single evaluator, the unique total average score of the evaluator is calculated. Afterwards the different scores of the evaluators are compiled for calculating the final score for every city.<br>  To determine the proportion of cities with a structure of direct participation of civil society in urban planning and management which functions regularly and democratically, an average point will be used on the Likert scale of 2.5. The value of the indicator is the proportion of the cities with a general score which is higher than the average point.<br>  As a result, if we have N cities selected for assessment in a certain country and n is the number of cities with scores which are higher than the average point, the value of the indicator will be calculated as follows:<br>  Value of indicator = (N/n)*100<br> ","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"11.3.2  Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically ","source_data_source_1":"2) Data on population - NBS ","source_data_supplier_1":"United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN HABITAT)<br> ","source_organisation_1":"1.Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment <br>  2.United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN HABITAT)<br> ","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment","source_periodicity_1":"Once every 3/4 years","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/c668a137c13a542f480233edcff3476972c2b897","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/296b9781b6f7196241f6709581c7e08c480f756a","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-11.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 2066kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"11.3.2","indicator_name":"Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically","indicator_sort_order":"11-03-02","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/11-3-2/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"11","target":"By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries","target_id":"11.3","graph_title":"Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically","un_custodian_agency":"UN-Habitat","un_designated_tier":"3","previous":"11-3-1","next":"11-4-1","page_content":""}}
