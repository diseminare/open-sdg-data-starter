national_indicator_available: 'Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM10) in cities,  µg/m3'
computation_calculations: >-
  Annual mean level of fine particulate matter represents the arithmetic average
  of fine particulate matter weighted per urban population and expressed in
  micrograms per cubic meter. Particulate matter with fraction10 mkm is
  determined via the automated method of measurement, is based on cyclone
  principle, meant to determine the mass concentration of the fibrinogen
  fraction sized  <10  mkm  in atmospheric air.
computation_definitions: >-
  Particulate matter with fraction 10 mkm (PM-10) in urban localities represents
  air pollution mainly in fine duster, and includes a combination of solid and
  liquid particulates characterised via their reduced dimensions - up to 10 mkm.
  About 60% of PM10 is composed of particulate of type PM2.5, with diameter
  under 2.5 microns. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to
  fine particulate (PM2.5) has the most significant impact on human health as
  compared to other pollutants. In 2015, the average level of PM2.5 in cities
  was 15 micrograms per cubic meter and 16.7, in 2016 ( [see

  Atmosphere air quality monitoring: The operation network for atmospheric air
  quality monitoring includes 18 stationary posts, 17 of which are located in 5
  industrialised centres: Chisinau - 6 posts, Balti-2, Tiraspol-3, Bender-4,
  Ribnita-2, and 1 transborder station in Leova town.<br>  The samples are taken
  at those 17 stations 3 times per day (07:00, 13:00 and 19:00), analysing the
  basic pollutants (solid matters, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen
  dioxide) and the specific ones (soluble sulphates, nitrogen oxide, aldehyde,
  phenol and  benzo(a)pyrene). The program of observation, collection of samples
  and chemical analysis is carried out according to the methodology 
  "Руководство по контролю загрязнения атмосферы, РД 52.04. 186-89-Москва 1991”
  - Guidelines for atmospheric air pollution control. [The air pollution
  level](http://mediu.gov.md/ro/content/protec%C8%9Bia-aerului-atmosferic) is
  assesses according to the value of mean concentration as compared to the
  maximum admissible concentration (CMA), and the quality of air is estimated
  through air pollution complex index (IPA).<br>

  The global indicator refers to the mean concentration of PM2.5, weighted per
  urban population and it is estimated using the satellite data, population
  estimates, topographic data and measurements in the field. The national
  indicator refers to the mean concentration of PM10,  including PM2.5 and is
  based on measurements in the field.
