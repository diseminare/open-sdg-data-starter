  Coverage of essential health services
computation_calculations: >-
  This indicator represents an index presented according to a scale from 0 to 100, which is calculated via geometric average of 14 indicators tracing the coverage with essential health services. <br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  The average coverage with essential health services is assessed based on the monitoring procedures for reproductive health, maternal health, new-borns' health and children's health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and the service capacity and access, among the general population and the most deprived population. The 14 indicators tracing the coverage with health services are grouped in 4 categories:<br> 
  I. Reproduction, maternity, new-borns' and children's health:<br> 
  1) Family planning: Share of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) with their family planning needs satisfied through modern methods of contraception (Indicator SDG 3.7.1.);<br> 
  2) Pregnancy and birth supervision: Share of women aged 15-49 years old with live births in a determined period of time, who received antenatal care four or more times; <br> 
  3) Children's vaccination: Share of children who received three vaccine doses containing diphtheria - tetanus -pertussis;<br> 
  4) Children's treatment: Share of children aged under 5 years old with suspected pneumonia (cough, dyspnoea, not due to a chest problem or sunny nose) during two week before examination by the corresponding medical institution.<br> 
  II. Infectious diseases:<br> 
  5) TB: share of new TB cases detected and successfully treated;<br> 
  6) HIV/AIDS: Share of persons living with HIV receiving antiviral treatment;<br> 
  7) Malaria: Share of persons from endemic areas for malaria, who sleep during the night under an insecticide-treated net (Not relevant for Moldova);<br> 
  8) Water supply and sanitation: Share of households using improved water supply and sanitation facilities;<br> 
  III. Non-communicable diseases:<br> 
  9) Hypertension: Standardised prevalence according to the age of not high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg. or diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg.) among adult population 18 years old and over;<br> 
  10) Diabetes: Average value of plasma glucose, in fasting, standardised according to age (mmol/L) for adults 25 years old and over;<br> 
  11) Tobacco: Standardised prevalence according to age among adults >=15 years old who did not smoke tobacco over the last 30 days (Indicator SDG 3.a.1. - see the description there);<br> 
  IV.Services' capacity and access:<br> 
  12. Access to hospitalization: hospital beds per person, out of a maximum ceiling of 18 per 10,000 population;<br> 
  13) Labour force in health: Health professionals (doctors, psychiatrists, surgeons) per person, in relation to the maximum value of the ceiling for every specialist  (part of indicator SDG 3.c.1.)<br> 
  14) Health security: basic capacity index of International Health Regulations (IHR), which is the average share attributed for 13 basic capacities which were achieved (SDG. 3.d.1. global metadata)
