  Extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools by providers of development cooperation
computation_calculations: >-
  The indicator calculates the extent to which the objectives, results-based indicator and monitoring indicators related to the new development interventions are extracted from governmental sources, including: national, sector and local planning tools. For every significant development intervention (100.000 USD or more) approved during the year of reference, the following parameters are assessed:<br> 
  Q1. If the objectives are extracted from the results frameworks, government plans and strategies. where: <br> 
  0, Objectives are not extracted from the results frameworks, plans and strategies implemented by the Government; 1, Objectives are extracted from results frameworks, plans and strategies implemented by the Government;<br> 
  Q2. Share of outcome (output) indicators which are extracted from the results frameworks, plans and strategies of the government, % <br> 
  where: Numerator (no): Number of outcome (output) indicators extracted from the results frameworks of the Government or other existing planning documents; Denominator (n): Total number of outcome (output) indicators included in the project's results framework.<br> 
  Q3. Share of outcome (output) indicators which will be based on the data sources supplied by the existing monitoring systems in the country or by the national statistics services to trace the progress of the indicator %. Where: Numerator (ns): Number of outcome (output) indicators to be traced using the governmental statistics, the data sources or the Monitoring and Evaluation system (meaning sources that are not specific to the project); Denominator (n): Total number of outcome (output) indicators included from the project results' framework.<br> 
  Aggregation of the indicator is carried out by mediating the three dimensions of the alignment with the national objectives and priorities of the new interventions in the year of reference. The aggregation will not consider the size of the project, so as to provide the same level of importance for the use level of the national framework of results and planning tools in medium and small projects. Otherwise, the weight depending on the size of the project will represent excessively the infrastructure projects and will sub-represent the interventions meant to influence the institutional policies and arrangements. The calculation formula for aggregation of the indicator are presented on page 28 of [the following source](http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf)<br>

  The aim of the indicator is to try to see the general behaviour of the development partners in developing new intervention measures in the country, taking into account and observing the country's priorities. According to the global metadata, the monitoring of this indicator is a voluntary process led by every country separately. The Government of the country leads and coordinates the collection and validation of data.
