  National legislation defines the following notions regarding the water bodies: 1) artificial water body – surface water body created for human activity; 2) surface water body  – distinct and significant part of a surface water, such as: lake, reservoir, pond, water course – river or canal, segment of a water course  – river or canal, transitory water; 3) underground water body – distinct volume of underground water within the limits of an aquifer or a number of aquifers.<br> 
  Environmental quality requirements for surface water regarding the physical-chemical, hydro- biological, microbiological, virologic and helminthological parameters are set in Annex No. 1 to the GD No. 890/2013 approving the Regulation on environmental quality requirements  for surface water.
