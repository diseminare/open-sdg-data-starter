national_indicator_available: Coverage of essential health services
computation_calculations: >-
  This indicator represents an index presented according to a scale from 0 to
  100, which is calculated via geometric average of 14 indicators tracing the
  coverage with essential health services. <br>
computation_definitions: >-
  The average coverage with essential health services is assessed based on the
  monitoring procedures for reproductive health, maternal health, new-borns'
  health and children's health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases
  and the service capacity and access, among the general population and the most
  deprived population. The 14 indicators tracing the coverage with health
  services are grouped in 4 categories:<br> I. Reproductive, maternal, newborn
  and child health: <br>  1)Family planning: Share of women of reproductive age
  (15-49 years old) with their family planning needs satisfied through modern
  methods of contraception (Indicator SDG 3.7.1.);<br>  2) Pregnancy and
  delivery care: Share of women aged 15-49 years old with live births in a
  determined period of time, who received antenatal care four or more times;
  <br>  3) Child immunization: Share of children who received three vaccine
  doses containing diphtheria - tetanus -pertussis;<br>  4)Children's treatment:
  Share of children aged under 5 years old with suspected pneumonia (cough,
  dyspnoea, not due to a chest problem or sunny nose) during two week before
  examination by the corresponding medical institution.<br>  II. Infectious
  diseases:<br>  5) TB: share of new TB cases detected and successfully
  treated;<br>  6) HIV/AIDS: Share of persons living with HIV receiving
  antiretroviral treatment;<br>  7) Malaria: Share of persons from endemic areas
  for malaria, who sleep during the night under an insecticide-treated net (Not
  relevant for Moldova);<br>  8)Water and sanitation: Share of households using
  at least basic sanitation facilities;<br>  III. Non-communicable
  diseases:<br>  9)Hypertension: Age-standardized prevalence of non-raised blood
  pressure (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure <90
  mm Hg) among adults aged 18 years and older;<br>  10) Diabetes:
  Age-standardized mean fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) for adults aged 18 years
  and older;<br>  11) Tobacco: Age-standardized prevalence of adults >=15 years
  not smoking tobacco in last 30 days (Indicator SDG 3.a.1. - see the
  description there);<br> IV. Service capacity and access <br>  12) Hospital
  access: Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per
  10,000 population;<br>  13) Health workforce: Health professionals
  (physicians, psychiatrists, and surgeons) per capita, relative to maximum
  thresholds for each cadre (part of indicator SDG 3.c.1.);<br>  14) Health
  security: International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is
  the average percentage of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been
  attained (SDG. 3.d.1. global metadata).
