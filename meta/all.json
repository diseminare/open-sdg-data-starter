In 2015, the average level of PM2.5 in cities was 15 micrograms per cubic meter and 16.7, in 2016 ( [see source](http://www.green-economies-eap.org/resources/Raport_RO.pdf) )<br>  Atmosphere air quality monitoring: The operation network for atmospheric air quality monitoring includes 18 stationary posts, 17 of which are located in 5 industrialised centres: Chisinau - 6 posts, Balti-2, Tiraspol-3, Bender-4, Ribnita-2, and 1 transborder station in Leova town.<br>  The samples are taken at those 17 stations 3 times per day (07:00, 13:00 and 19:00), analysing the basic pollutants (solid matters, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide) and the specific ones (soluble sulphates, nitrogen oxide, aldehyde, phenol and  benzo(a)pyrene).

To assess these flows, quantitative and qualitative information may be used, as obtained from financial authorities, central banks, and other entities involved in money laundering and financial offences.<br> ","computation_definitions":"The indicator measures the total value of illicit financial flows entering and exiting the country (IFF) expressed in current USD.

Only a limited number of tariff rates which are not ad valorem (meaning technical charges) cannot be supplied by ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation. This methodology allows as well for countries to be compared.

(Reporters without frontiers). The questionnaire is composed on 87 questions and is translated into 20 languages. Qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data regarding abuses and violence against journalists during the evaluated period.

This rate is calculated using Own Funds (of Level 1) as basis for numerator and total assets as denominator. Data are compiled in line with the guiding lines from Basel I or Basel II, and since II quarter 2018 - according to Basel III.<br>  (2) Rate of own funds of level I out of the risk-weighted assets  <br>  I2 Own funds of Level 1 as basis for risk-weighted assets. Data for this indicator of Financial Stability are also compiled in line with the guiding lines from Basel I or Basel II, and since the II quarter 2018 - according to Basel III. This measures the sufficiency of banks' capital according to the basic capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). <br>  (3) Rate of net non-performing loans as related to the total own funds: <br>  I3 Net non-performing loans as related to the total own funds. This indicator of Financial Stability is calculated by taking the value of non-performing loans (NPL) minus the value of discounts calculated for the non-performing loans as numerator and the value of own funds as denominator. The capital is measures as total capital and reserves in the sector balance; for the cross-border consolidated data, may be used as own total capital. This indicator of Financial Stability is one of the capital sufficiency rate, being an important indicator which reflects the capacity of the banking capital to cope with the losses from non-preforming loans.  (4) Share of non-performing loans in the total provided loans: <br>  I4 Non-performing loans as related to total gross loans. This indicator is calculated by using the value of non-performing loans as nominator and the total value of loan portfolio (including non-performing loans) as denominator. This indicator is frequently used as a proxy for quality of assets and is meant to identify the problems related to the quality of assets in the loans' portfolio. <br>  (5) Return on assets: <br>  I6 The return on assets is calculated by dividing the net revenue before the items and extraordinary taxes (according to the FSI Guide recommendations) to the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) for the same period of reference. This indicator of Financial Stability is of bank profitability and is meant to measure use efficiency by the holders of deposits of their assets.<br>  (6) Rate of liquid assets as related to the short-term liabilities  <br>  I11 Liquid assets as related to short-term liabilities. This indicator is calculated using the basic measure of liquid assets as nominator and the short-term liabilities as denominator. The ratio may be calculated taking as nominator the wide measure of liquid assets. This indicator is a rate of liquid assets as is meant to capture the incompliance of liquidities between assets and liabilities, and offers information about the extent to which the depositors may perform the withdrawal of short-term funds without having problems of liquidities.<br>  (7) Rate of net open foreign currency position as related to total own funds <br>  I12 The net open foreign currency position as related to own funds. The open foreign currency position calculated based on the BCBS recommendations. Own funds should represent the basic total own funds or own funds of level 1, as the open foreign currency positions is a supervision concept. This indicator is sensible to market risk, which is perceived as reflecting the exposure of depositors to the exchange risk as compared to the capital. It measures the incompliance of assets and liabilities in foreign currency to asses the vulnerability to foreign currency exchange fluctuations.","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"10.5.1.

Identification and selection of these 5 experts/evaluators will be guided by local teams of urban observers available in a number of cities. During the pilot exercises, these urban observers, as local holders of urban data at the city level, are able to coordinate the evaluations and to verify the consequences and relevant local references, guiding the decisions and the scores of the evaluators.<br>  To measure and test the existence of some structures of participation of civil society in urban governance and management, the Likert questionnaire will be used with a scale of 4 points (do not agree at all, do not agree, agree, and fully agree). These structures will be reviewed via four basic elements which were assessed within pilot exercises, as follows:<br>  1. Are there structures for civil society to participate in urban planning, including designs and agreements, in a direct, regular and democratic way?<br>  2. Are there structures for civil society to participate in decision-making about local urban budget in a direct, regular and democratic way?<br>  3. Are there structures for civil society assessment and reaction regarding urban management performance, which would be in a direct, regular and democratic way?<br>  4. Are these structures promoting participation of women, men and young people and/or other marginalized groups?<br>  Once all the above elements are assessed by one single evaluator, the unique total average score of the evaluator is calculated.

To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens\u2019 entitlement to public information. <br>  Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific  principles  and  professional  ethics,  on  the  methods  and  procedures  for  the  collection,  processing,  storage  and  presentation of statistical data.<br>  Principle 3. To  facilitate  a  correct  interpretation  of  the  data,  the  statistical  agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics.<br>  Principle 4. The  statistical  agencies  are  entitled  to  comment  on  erroneous  interpretation and misuse of statistics.<br>  Principle 5. Data  for  statistical  purposes  may  be  drawn  from  all  types  of  sources,  be  they  statistical  surveys  or  administrative  records.  Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents.<br>  Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation,  whether  they  refer  to  natural  or  legal  persons,  are  to  be  strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.<br>  Principle 7. The  laws,  regulations  and  measures  under  which  the  statistical  systems operate are to be made public.<br>  Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system.<br>  Principle 9. The  use  by  statistical  agencies  in  each  country  of  international  concepts,  classifications  and  methods  promotes  the  consistency  and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels.<br>  Principle 10. Bilateral  and  multilateral  cooperation  in  statistics  contributes  to  the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries.","computation_units":"Yes/no","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"17.18.2.1 Availability of national statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics","source_data_source_1":"1) National normative framework in the area of statistics <br>  2) Survey based on online questionnaire PARIS21 SDG Survey ","source_data_supplier_1":"National Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_1":"1.National Bureau of Statistics<br>  2.Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21)","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"1.National Bureau of Statistics<br>  2.Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21)","source_periodicity_1":"Quarter I 2018","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/c668a137c13a542f480233edcff3476972c2b897","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/296b9781b6f7196241f6709581c7e08c480f756a","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-18-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 468kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"17.18.2","indicator_name":"Number of countries that have national statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics","indicator_sort_order":"17-18-02","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/17-18-2/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"17","target":"By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts","target_id":"17.18","graph_title":"Number of countries that have national statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics","un_custodian_agency":"UNSD,PARIS21, Regional Commissions,World Bank","un_designated_tier":"2","previous":"17-18-1","next":"17-18-3","page_content":""}},"16-6-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-16.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 1361kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"16.6.1","indicator_name":"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or\u00a0by budget codes or similar)","indicator_sort_order":"16-06-01","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/16-6-1/","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"16","target":"Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels","target_id":"16.6","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank","un_designated_tier":"1","previous":"16-5-2","next":"16-6-2","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","national_indicator_available":"Actual reported government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (by budget classification codes or other similar codes)","computation_calculations":"The methodology for calculating this indicator is presented within an extended table (called \u201eCalculation Sheet for PFM Performance Indicators PI-1 and PI-2 (i)\u201d ) on [the PEFA web page](http://www.pefa.org/sites/default/files/En-PI-1%20%26%20PI-2%20Exp%20calculation-Jan%202015.xls).

The country is assessed separately on a ordinal scale in four points: A, B, C or D, in line with exact criteria:<br>  (A) Total expenditures varied from 95% to 105% of the total budgetary expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.<br>  (B) Total expenditures varied from 90% to 110% of the total budgetary expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.<br>  (C) Cumulative expenditures varied from 85% to 115% of total budgetary expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.<br>  (D) Productivity is lower than the one which is necessary for C degree.<br> ","computation_definitions":"This indicator measures the degree in which the result of cumulated budgetary expenditures reflects the initially approved amount, as it was defined in the documentation on the state budget and fiscal reports. The coverage is the consolidated state budget and the covered time period is the last three finished fiscal years. The indicator attempts to reflect the reliability of the state budget. The cumulated expenditures include the real expenditures which cover the expenditures incurred as a result of some unplanned or exceptional events  - for instance, armed conflicts or natural disasters. Expenditures financed through unexpected revenues, including through privatisation, should be included and recorded in fiscal tables and in narrative support. Expenditures financed externally through loans or subventions should be included, if they are covered by the budget, together with the emergency vote and loan interest rates. Expenditures allocated to waiting accounts are not included in total. Nevertheless, if the amounts are held in suspension accounts at the end of every year, which could affect the scores if included in the calculation, they can be included. In such cases, the reasons for inclusion should be clearly indicated.<br>  Actual expenditures may deviate from the initially approved budget due to reasons independent from accuracy of previsions - for instance, as a result of a major macro-economic shock. The calibration of this indicator supports an unusual or \"exceeded\" year and focuses on deviations from previsions, which appear on two out of the three years which are subject to evaluation.","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"16.6.1 Actual reported government expenditures as a proportion of original approved

When estimating the land consumption rate, it is important to clearly define what land \"consumption\" means, because this may cover \"consumed\" or \"preserved\" or available for \"development\" aspects for such cases as land covered with wet zones. Secondly, there is no unequivocal measure for the land if the land under development is really \"newly-developed\" (or free) or if it is at least partially \u201eredeveloped\u201c.
