  Prevalence of undernourishment
computation_definitions: >-
  The indicator is estimated by FAO, based on 4 parameters: Average Dietary Energy Consumption (DEC), Coefficient of Variation (CV) of dietary energy consumption, Skewness of Dietary Energy Consumption (SK), and Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) per day.   <br> 
  The source to estimate DEC is the information from  Balance of food resources (includes official information about production, trade and use of food products) which is provided by NBS to FAO, based on a questionnaire for data collection every year. The source for estimating CV and SK will be the  Household Budget Survey, especially the information about food products in the expenditures modules.
