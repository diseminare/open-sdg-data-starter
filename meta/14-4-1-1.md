indicator_definition: >-
  The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
  measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their
  abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level,
  that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as
  biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY
  level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.
published: true
target: >-
  By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal,
  unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and
  implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in
  the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum
  sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics

  Total number of illegal fishing violations registered by competent authorities

computation_definitions: >-
  Illegal fishing violation- a violation of the established fishing rules, which
  does not represent an offence, and which is sanctioned with an administrative
  fine, the amount of which is established in contravention units and varies for
  individuals and legal entities depending on how severe the violation was (art.
  114, para. 2 of the Contravention Code No. 218 of 24.10.2008)

  Unlike the global indicator which refers to fish reserves at sustainable
  biological levels in ocean and maritime areas, the national indicator refers
  to protection and maintaining the fish reserves at sustainable biological
  levels in the country's water bodies
