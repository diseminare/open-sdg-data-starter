indicator_definition: >-
  Proportion of water bodies (area) in a country with good ambient water quality
  compared to all water bodies in the country. “Good” indicates an ambient water
  quality that does not damage ecosystem function and human health according to
  core ambient water quality indicators.
published: true
target: >-
  By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and
  minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the
  proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and
  safe reuse globally

  Drinking water - water intended for human consumption. The sanitary norms
  regarding the quality of drinking water are described in the annexes of Law
  no. 182 regarding the quality of drinking water from 19.12.2019 and annex no.
  2 of GD no. 934 of 15.08.2007. The quality of drinking water is compliant if
  the values established for the quality parameters correspond to those provided
  in the Annexes for sampling.
computation_calculations: >-
  Number of objectives (underground centralized sources, centralized surface
  sources, decentralized water supply sources (wells)) non-compliant with
  sanitary norms according to water quality compared to the number of operating
  objectives * 100
comparison_global: >-
  The global indicator refers to water bodies and their water quality: untreated
  water from rivers, lakes, while this indicator refers only to drinking water
  sources.
