According to the international definition, IWRM represents a process that promotes development and coordinated management of water, land plots and related resources, to maximize economic and social wellbeing in a fair way, without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.<br>  The IWRM concept is measured under 4 main components : <br>  1. Favourable environment: includes policies, laws, plans and strategies which create a \u201epermissive/favourable environment\u201d for IWRM.<br>  2. Institutions: include the duties and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions which contribute to supporting IWRM implementation.<br>  3. Management tools: tools and actions allowing the decision makers and users to make rational and informed choices among the alternative actions.<br>  4. Financing. Budgeting and financing are available and used for developing and managing water resources from different sources.","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"6.5.1 Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0\u2013100)","source_data_source_1":"Administrative data for filling in the answers in the Questionnaire ","source_data_supplier_1":"Agency \u201cApele Moldovei\u201d (Moldovan Water)","source_organisation_1":"Agency \u201cApele Moldovei\u201d (Moldovan Water)","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment","source_periodicity_1":"Once every 3 years","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-06-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/2727c99dd477f1c79332e0d6f5cf6ea6348df24f","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/296b9781b6f7196241f6709581c7e08c480f756a","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-06-05-01.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 410 KB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"6.5.1","indicator_name":"Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0-100)","indicator_sort_order":"06-05-01","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/6-5-1/","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"6","target":"By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate","target_id":"6.5","graph_title":"Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0-100)","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)","un_designated_tier":"1","previous":"6-4-2","next":"6-5-2","page_content":""}}
