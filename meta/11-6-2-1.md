  11.6.2.1. Quantity of emissions of polluting substances in the air from mobile
  sources (by sources)
computation_calculations: >-
  Emissions from mobile sources are assessed based on the quantity of fuel used
  by mobile sources
computation_definitions: >-
  Emissions of pollutants in the atmosphere represents the volume of polluting
  substances from the mobile sources discharged in the atmosphere air. All the
  pollutants discharged in the atmosphere air are recorded, both after they pass
  through installation for capturing dust and gas from organised pollution
  sources, as well as without treatment from the organised and unorganised
  pollution sources.<br>  Mobile pollution sources are:<br>  1) road
  transport;<br>  2) railroad – represented by the State Enterprise "Railroad of
