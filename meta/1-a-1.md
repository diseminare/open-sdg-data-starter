  For the purpose of reducing poverty and making more efficient the targeting of the state social transfers towards the poorest and the most vulnerable, starting in 2008 the Program „Ajutor social” has been implemented. The Program is composed of two main components – social allowance and the allowance for the cold period of the year. The aim of the program is to ensure the poor families with a guaranteed minimum monthly income (GMMI) which is annually indexed on April 1, depending on the annual increase of the Consumption Price Index for the previous year, as established by the Government (art. 7 (3) of the Law No. 133/2008 on Social Allowance). The eligibility for benefits provided in the Ajutor Social Program is determined based on the Methodology used to assess the monthly average global income of the family and the need of social assistance (a set of Proxy indicators).<br>
