  16.7.2 Proportion of population who believe decision-making is inclusive and
  responsive
computation_calculations: >-
  The indicator is calculated based on the answers of survey respondents for two
  questions that tackle two distinct dimensions, such as inclusive participation
  in decision-making and taking responsive decisions by the Government:<br>  1)
  To what extent do you consider that the policy system in the Republic of
  Moldova allows the persons like you to express themselves about the
  Government's actions? <br>  2) To what extent do you consider that the policy
  system in the Republic of Moldova allows the persons like you to have an
  influence on policies?<br>  The answers are: At all, Very unlikely, A little,
  Very likely, A lot, Refuse, Do not know, Non-response.<br>
computation_definitions: >-
  This indicator is based on surveys and measures the level of self-assessment
  of "external efficiency of policies‚Äù, meaning the extent to which the
  population considers that politicians and/or political institutions will
  listen to and will act considering the opinions of ordinary citizens. To
  tackle both dimensions of this indicator, two questions are used within the
  survey/stud. The first question measures the extent to which people believe
  that they really can express their opinion about what the Government does
  (inclusive participation in decision-making), and the second question measures
  the extent to which people feel that the political system allows them to have
  an influence on policies (focusing on responsive decision-making).<br>
