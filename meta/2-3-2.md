  Agricultural production as a value is assessed in current prices, as well as in comparable prices â€“ for comparability when calculating the relative indicators and it is determined as the sum of vegetal and animal production.<br> 
  According to FAO the small agricultural producers are the ones that:<br> 
  1) operate with a size of land plots that fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) from the cumulated distribution of the size of land plots at the national level (measured in hectares); and<br> 
  2) operate with a number of animals which fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) of the cumulated distribution of the number of animals per production unit at the national level (measured in livestock units); and<br> 
  3) obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities which fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) out of the cumulated distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at the national level (measured in purchasing power parity in USD), which does not exceed the amount of 34,387 USD at PPP

  Unlike the global indicator, where the small producers are defined according to the definition suggested by FAO, for calculating the national indicator, they use the national definition without sex disaggregation (small agricultural producers - farms with the area of agricultural land plots smaller than 10 ha and the farm).<br>
