  The indicator includes five categories: 1) wetlands with vegetation, 2) rivers
  and creeks, 3) lakes, 4) aquifer  5) artificial water bodies. The indicator is
  divided in 5 sub-indicators for capturing different sources of data and
  methodologies, which are necessary for monitoring the components of the
  indicator. The data sources derive from a combination of soils samples and
  observations regarding the soil. Depending on the type of ecosystem and type
  of measured degree, the methodology for collecting data may differ a lot. The
  5 sub-indicators are calculated separately according to 5 different
  methodologies: Sub-indicator 1: Spatial extension of water-related ecosystems;
  Sub-indicator 2: Quality of lakes and artificial water bodies; Sub-indicator
  3: Quantity (discharge) of water in rivers and creeks; Sub-indicator 4:
  Quality of water-related ecosystems; Sub-indicator 5: Quantity of underground
  water from aquifers.<br>  Sub-indicators 1 and 2: All the data available at
  the global level, generated for these sub-indicators, are shared with
  countries for validation. These geospatial data will be generated annually at
  the national, subnational and water levels. While these data are generated
  annually, the measurement for verifying the changes needs to be carried out
  once per 5 years. The annual validated data will be used by specialised
  agencies to generate percentage changes on behalf of the countries. <br> 
  Sub-indicators 3, 4 and 5: All the data collected in countries for these
  sub-indicators will be sent to specialised agencies for verification and
  control for quality assurance, in line with the minimum criteria of the
  methodology. This analysis process will be facilitated through communication
  via email through the global assistance service. After analysis of annual
  „raw” data, the calculation of percentage changes will be finished and
  validated between the specialised agencies and the national representative.

  data are also acceptable; <br>  4) in situ measurements in ecosystems related
  to water; <br>  5) in situ measurements at the level of underground water from
  underground aquifer, although the data are also simulated.
