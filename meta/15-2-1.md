  Progress towards sustainable forest management
computation_calculations: >-
  National data regarding the forest area, biomass stock, forests' surfaces in the protected areas and forestry area in the management plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for the pre-established years of reference. Based on the data reported by the country, FAO makes estimates at the country level for the rate of net change of forestry area using the formula of compound interest. The proportion of the forest surface in the protected area and in the management plan is calculated using the reported areas and official surface of the FAOSTAT land for the year of reference 2015. The data regarding the forestry area within a certification system for forest management, independently verified, are reported to FAO by the central offices of the respective forestry certification scheme, which adjusts together the figures so as to eliminate any double accounting.<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  The indicator is composed of 5 sub-indicators which measure the progress towards all these dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental values related to forests are covered by three sub-indicators focused on extension of the forestry area, biomass in the forests' area, and protection and maintenance of biological diversity and cultural, natural, and associated resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with the environmental values via sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator offers an additional qualification for forest areas' management, by assessing the areas which are verified independently for observing a set of national and international standards.<br> 
  The 5 sub-indicators area: 1) Net annual rate of forestry area change; 2) Reserves above-ground biomass in forests; 3) Proportion of forestry area situated in the legally established protection areas; 4) Proportion of forestry area in line with the long-term forests' management plan; 5) Forestry area within forests' management certification system, verified independently
