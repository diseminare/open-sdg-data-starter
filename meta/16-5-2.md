computation_calculations: >-
  Total number of enterprises that answered „yes” the question if over the last 12 month they have made at least one informal payment (bribe) or offered a present to a tax official, or from who a bribe or a present was requested during the period of reference, out of the total number of enterprises included in the survey, who had at least one contact with a tax official during the respective period * 100<br> 
  For all the designs of the surveys in enterprises carried out since 2016, the resulting dataset is based on a weighted sample. Hence, the value of the indicator, which is calculated using Stata, includes these sampling weights, as well as the design layers.<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  Proportion of enterprises from whom a present or an informal payment (bribe) was requested, when they met fiscal officials. The data for this indicator are collected within [enterprises' surveys](http://www.enterprisesurveys.org), which include a standard question in which respondents are asked if they have been subject to an inspection or have been invited to meet with the representatives of tax authorities. If the respondents answer „yes”, there is a follow-up question, in which they are asked if it is expected for them to provide a present or to make an unofficial payment during such inspections / meetings. The response options are: „yes”, „no”, „do not know” and „refuse”.<br> 
  Enterprises' surveys are surveys carried out in enterprises in the World Bank's client countries. The survey focuses on different business environment aspects, as well as on outcome measures of the company, such as annual sale, productivity, etc. The survey is carried out for every country for about 4-5 years.<br> 
  The data for this indicator at the national level may be extracted from two sources: <br> 
  [study 2015, Q 14 from the Questionnaire for Businessmen] Over the last year, have you (or anyone from your enterprise) made unofficial payment or offered presents to employees of the following institutions/services/areas?<br> 
  [study 2018, questions E.1.1; E1.3. and E 1.] Have you interacted with the following institutions over the last 12 months?  Have you made unofficial payments over the last 12 months? Have you offered presents over the last 12 months? <br>

  The national indicator is similar to the global one, but the differences are as follows: the source for data collection differs, as for the global indicator they use surveys in enterprises carried out based on the World Bank methodology once per 4-5 years. Another difference would be the different questions in the national survey questionnaires carried out in 2015 and 2018, as well as certain difference in the data calculation formulas
