  The indicator refers to the proportion of adult population who feels safe
  while walking in the neighbourhood where they reside. The data for calculating
  this indicator are collected through sample-based surveys in general
  population, and most frequently the surveys on victimization are carried out
  for this purpose. There is a question in the surveys on victimization: "How
  safe do you feel when walking by yourself in your area/neighbourhood?‚Äù, and
  the answer options are: very safe/ sufficiently safe / not so safe / very
  unsafe / never walk alone in the evenings and at night / do not know <br>
