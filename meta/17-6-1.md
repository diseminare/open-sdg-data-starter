  The development of this indicator is part of the Global Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (GO-SPIN) UNESCO, which is a new tool of analysis and support to develop science, technological and innovative policies (STI). Based on the GO-SPIN survey, UNESCO collects information and data about the national landscape of research and innovation in the countries, the evolution of STI policies and STI policy cycles in 57 countries (21 countries from Latin America and Caribbean; 18 countries from Sub-Saharan Africa; 7 from Asia; 10 Arabian states and Israel).<br> 
  A section regarding the mapping of agreements and programs of cooperation in STI among countries is explicitly included, alongside the "acts, draft legislative acts, regulations and international agreements on STI‚Äù, which is already a part of the inventory. The relevant information for this indicator was already collected in a pilot set of 999 international cooperation treaties in 20 countries.<br>
