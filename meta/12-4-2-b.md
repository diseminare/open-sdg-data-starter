  Recycling (use): reintroduction in the economic circuit of waste as raw
  material, secondary material and their use after being processed as
  semi-manufactured, end products or energy.<br>  Treatment  of waste is the
  operation of harnessing or elimination, including the process of preparing
  prior to harnessing or elimination. <br>  Harnessing means any operation which
  ends with the fact that the waste serves for a useful purpose by replacing
  other materials which were used for a certain purpose or the fact that the
  waste is prepared so as it can serve the respective purpose in enterprises or
  in economy in general (annex 2 of the Law 209/2016 on Waste).<br>  Disposal of
  waste is any operation which is not harnessing even when one of its secondary
  consequences would be the recovery of substances or energy (Annex 1, Law
  209/2016 on Waste). (according to the European Directive).
