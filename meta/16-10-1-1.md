  Press Freedom Index is available for journalists from 180 countries and is
  determined by compiling the answers of experts in a questionnaire suggested by
  RSF (Reporters without frontiers). The questionnaire is composed on 87
  questions and is translated into 20 languages. Qualitative analysis is
  combined with quantitative data regarding abuses and violence against
  journalists during the evaluated period. The evaluation criteria and
  indicators from the questionnaire are: 1) pluralism; 2) independence of
  mass-media; 3) "self-censorship" existence and environment; 4) legislative
  framework; 5) transparency, and 6) quality of infrastructure supporting
  information production. Starting with the Index for 2013, countries are
  attributed scores between 0 and 100, where 0 is the possible score and 100 is
  the weakest score. This makes the Index to be more informative and makes
  easier the comparability of one year with another. <br>  In 2017 and 2018 the
  Republic of Moldova got the ranking of 81 out of 180 with a value of the score
  of 30,41 and respectively 30,01.
