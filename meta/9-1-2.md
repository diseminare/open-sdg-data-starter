  .aFreight record by mode of transport (air, road, railroad, river), miltons - km
computation_calculations: >-
  Freight record = amount obtained by multiplying the weight in tons of the transported freight by modes of transport (air, road, railroad, river) * distance in km travelled by the respective freight/cargo. <br> 
  Note: global metadata recommend reporting the indicator regarding the railroad transport only on the territory of the country. The national indicator on railroad transportation may be reported both for the territory of the country, as well as for the territory outside the country.<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  Freight record is determined depending on the weight of the transported freight and the distances travelled by the vehicles transporting the freight, from the loading place (expedition) until the unloading place (destination).<br>
