  Percentage value of weighted average applied to import of goods from chapter 01-97 of the Harmonised System of Goods' Description and Coding. <br>

  The indicator is estimated based on the data on import tariffs. To include all tariffs, some charges which are not expressed in an ad valorem form (for instance, special charges) are transformed in ad valorem equivalents (meaning as a percentage of the import value). Conversions is carried out at a tariff for every importer, using the unit cost method. The values of the import unit are calculated from the import values and quantities. Only a limited number of tariff rates which are not ad valorem (meaning technical charges) cannot be supplied by ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation. This methodology allows as well for countries to be compared. The measures and fees for trade remediation are not considered to be tariffs.<br> 
  Classification of goods is carried out based on the provisions of the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (joined by the Republic of Moldova in 2004 via Law No. 112 ), is one of the basic documents developed by the World Customs Organization. To unify the classification of goods, they use the annex of the given Convention, which includes the Universal Nomenclature of Commodities, currently used by 207 countries of the works as basis for customs tariffs for export/import, as well for statistical purpose. The Combine Nomenclature of Commodities is divided in 21 sections, 97 chapters, 1200 tariff items and over 5100 tariff sub-items, used as basis for developing and managing the Integrated Customs Tariff of the Republic of Moldova  (TARIM). TARIM stores information regarding the tariff measures and economic policy measures applied to imported commodities in the Republic of Moldova/exported from the Republic of Moldova. TARIM is published on the official web page of the Customs Service (Law No. 172 of  25.07.2014approving the Combined Nomenclature of Commodities).<br>
