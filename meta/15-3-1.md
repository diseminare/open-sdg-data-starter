  Degraded land – land fields, regardless of their ownership right, which through erosion, pollution or destructive actions of some anthropogenic factors, have lost for good their agricultural production capacity, but which may be improved by reforestation and works for ecosystems' recovery, for the purpose of protecting the soil, recovering the hydrological balance and improving the environmental conditions. The degraded areas may be part within the land cadastre of the following categories: agricultural fields, other fields (clough, landslides, etc.), water, etc. The degraded land includes:<br> 
  a) fields with very severe and excessive surface erosion;<br> 
  b) fields with depth erosion – clough, trenches;<br> 
  c) fields affected by active landslides, crashes and cave-ins;<br> 
  d) sandy fields subject to wind or water erosion;<br> 
  e) salty fields;<br> 
  f) fields polluted with chemical or oil substances;<br> 
  g) fields covered by open quarry, with mining tailings, with production waste or domestic waste, etc.;<br> 
  h) affected or destroyed biota fields;<br> 
  i) fields with gravel, scree, rocks, torrential alluvial deposits;<br> 
  j) non-productive fields (Government Decision No.1186 of 28.10.2016 approving the Regulation on performing reforestation works on degraded fields under public property of administrative-territorial units and degraded fields under private property).
