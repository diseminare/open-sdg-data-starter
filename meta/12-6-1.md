  The purpose of the indicator is to measure the companies' contribution to
  sustainable development. To calculate the indicator, they will consider the
  companies which publish sustainability information covering the following
  details on sustainability, which are divided into minimum and advanced
  criteria:<br>  1) Minimum criteria:<br>  Institutional and governance
  framework: • Material evaluation; • Sustainability strategy and / or
  sustainability-related principles; • Management approach to settle material
  subjects; • Governance structure, including for economic, environmental and
  social problems<br>  • Impacts, risks, key opportunities; • Practices for
  combatting fraud, anticorruption and anti-competition <br>  Economic: • Direct
  measurement of economic performance (revenues, net profit, added value,
  payments to shareholders); • Indirect measurement of economic performance
  (community investments, investments in infrastructure or other important local
  economic impact)<br>  Environmental:• Energy consumption and energy
  efficiency; • Waste use, wastewater generation, integrated practices for
  waster resources management or water recycling / reuse and efficiency; •
  Greenhouse gas emission; • Other emissions and effluents, including substances
  which destroy ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur oxides (SOX) and chemical
  substances; • Generation of waste, including hazardous waste; • Practices for
  minimizing and recycling waste; • Use and / or production of hazardous
  chemical substances <br>  Social: • Occupational health and security; • Total
  number of employees, depending on the type of contract and sex; • Training of
  employees; • Incorrect and illegal work practices and other aspects regarding
  human rights; • Diversity, equality of chances and discrimination in
  governance bodies and among employees; • Workers' rights and collective
  contracts.<br>  The respective methodology allows applying the principle
  „respect or explain” for the minimum standard, which allows the reporting
  entities to point out why certain information is not relevant for their
  companies and will make it more accessible for small companies. However, this
  would not apply to problems which were identified as material for the company,
  which should be reported.<br>  2) Advanced requirements: include the
  complementary information / indicators for the minimum criteria, which
  are:<br>  Institutional and governance framework: • Details about the supply
  chain; • Details about involvement of interested parties in relation to
  sustainability performance; • Details about remuneration <br>  Economic:•
  Sustainable public procurement policies and practices; • Percentage or
  proportion of local procurements / providers; • Charity donations <br> 
  Environmental: • Assessment of supplying environment; • Consumption of
  materials, supply of materials, and recycled or used materials; • Energy
  intensity and renewable energy sources; • Water intensity and integrated
  management of water resources; • GES intensity; • Waste intensity; • Impact on
  biodiversity; • Commitment of supplier and consumer / client for environmental
  issues <br>  Social: • Social assessment of suppliers; • Local community
  impact; • Commitment of suppliers and consumers for sustainability issues <br>
