  1. Municipal waste collected by NBS do no include the waste generate by
  industrial and agricultural enterprises* <br>  2. To calculate the global
  indicator, denominator - total generated municipal waste is calculated from
  the sum of municipal waste regularly collected and the quantity of uncollected
  waste (which is not estimated/calculated in Moldova)<br>  3. The control level
  according to the global methodology cannot be assessed, as well as to what
  extent the treatment and final storage of waste is "adequate".

computation_definitions: >-
  Municipal waste - household waste and similar waste from commercial,
  industrial and administrative activities, mentioned in item 20 of the List of
  wastes, approved by the Government (Law on waste no. 209/2016, GD no. 99/2018,
  for the approval of the Waste List). The degree of compliance of the landfill
  can be assessed using qualitative criteria that include: 1) the degree of
  control of waste reception and general management of the landfill site; 2) the
  degree of control of the waste over the treatment and disposal and 3) the
  degree of monitoring and verification of the control over the environment. A
  score of at least 10 of each criterion is the threshold required to be
  considered "appropriate final treatment and elimination".
