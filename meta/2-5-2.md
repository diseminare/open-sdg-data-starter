computation_calculations: >-
  Indicator is based on the most recent data stored in [the Global Data Bank for
  Domestic Animal Resources](http://www.fao.org/dad-is/en/) at the moment of
  calculation. The risk classes are defined depending on the size of the breed
  populations reported in the DAD-IS. <br>
computation_definitions: >-
  1) The risk class is considered to be "unknown‚Äù if (i) the population is not
  reported or (ii) the most recent size of the reported population refers to the
  year over 10 years ago before the year of calculation (the disruption point 10
  years).<br>  2) The risk classes are defined as follows: Indicator represent
  the percentage of animal breeds classified as at risk, which are not exposed
  to risk or the risk of extinction is not known during a period of reference,
  as well as the trends of these shares.
