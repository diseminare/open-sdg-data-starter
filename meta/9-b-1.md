  Proportion of medium and high-tech industry gross value added in total value added of manufacturing industry

  Gross added value of medium and high-tech industry  / total gross value added in manufacturing industry *100.<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  Gross value added (GVA) is the balance of the production account and is measured as the difference between the value of manufactured goods and services (assessed at the basic prices) and the intermediary consumption (assessed at the buyer's prices), hence representing the newly created value in the production process. GVA is distributed by economic activities according to  NACE rev.2. <br> 
  Manufacturing industry = section C in CAEM Rev.2.<br> 
  ["Medium and high-tech" activities - of OECD](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oecd-taxonomy-of-economic-activities-based-on-r-d-intensity_5jlv73sqqp8r-en), or [Eurostat classification](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:High-tech_classification_of_manufacturing_industries) - which are similar with small exceptions.
