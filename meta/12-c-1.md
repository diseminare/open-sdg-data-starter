  Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)
  and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels
indicator_sort_order: 12-cc-01
published: true
reporting_status: notstarted
target: >-
  Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful
  consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national
  circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those
  harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts,
  taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing
  countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in
  a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities

  12.c.1 Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and
  consumption) and as a proportion of total expenditures in the National Public
  Budget on fossil fuels
computation_calculations: >-
  The indicator covers reporting on 3 sub-indicators regarding the categories of
  subsidies as a proportion of GDP, and namely:<br>  1) Direct budgetary
  transfers of funds and liabilities; <br>  2) Induced transfers (revenues or
  price subsidies offered to producers or consumers through different
  regulations) <br>  3) Missed tax revenues (revenues that the government would
  benefit from if the tax rates are higher)  - according to the global metadata,
  this may be optional.<br>  Sub-indicator 1. Direct transfers:<br>  - these are
  reflected in the state budget or institutions' budgets, by programs or types
  of fuel <br>  - include: Products subsidies =  amounts provided from the
  budget per unit of produced or imported good or service, and Other production
  subsidies  = amounts provided from the budget for covering losses.  (National
  definition according to SCN) <br>  - include support for corporations involved
  in producing and transforming energy (report in their annual reports)<br> 
  Sub-indicator 2. Induced transfers: are measured by estimating the price
  differences (price-gap) between the producers' and consumers' prices and a
  reference price, multiplying this difference with the produced or consumed
  volume for which price reduction was applied.<br>  Sub-indicator 3. Tax
  exempts: imply measuring the special measures introduced/applied in the Tax
  Code to favour certain sectors of the industry or industrial activities (such
  as capital investments in production). Such measures are reported in reports
  on issues related to taxes and fees. Wherever they are not applied, the
  analysts develop methods to estimated the differences in revenues which could
  have been collected to the budget under basic conditions but applying special
  taxes/fees. (=missed tax revenues)<br>  For "fossil fuels" - [see the
  definition from the column
