  institutions. Data users should be careful to document one single policy when
  gathering data in the reported years.
computation_definitions: >-
  Green Economy is the economic development contributing to increasing people's
  wellbeing and increasing social fairness, while reducing significantly the
  negative impact on environment.<br>  Sustainable Production and Consumption
  (SPC) - use of services and products related to them, which meet the basic
  needs and improve the quality of life, minimising the use of natural resources
  and toxic materials, as well as of waste and pollutants' emission during the
  life cycle of the service or product, so as not to endanger the consumption
  needs of the next generations <br>  Policy tools for sustainable production
  and consumption: the policy tools refer to methodologies, measures or
  interventions, which are used for achieving these objectives. In case of SPC,
  such tools are developed and applied so as to reduce the environmental impact
  of consumption and production models, for the purpose of generating economic
  and/or social benefits. <br>  (We have the Program for Promoting Green Economy
  2018-2020 and the Action Plan for implementing the Program for Promoting Green
  Economy in the Republic of Moldova for 2018-2020).
