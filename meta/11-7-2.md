  It is a survey-based indicator which measures the experience of different behavioural forms related to physical and sexual harassment. The questions related to physical and sexual harassment must be assessed separately, but the results may be combined. The calculation of this indicator needs to include a brief module of eight questions within a population representative survey, which are:<br> 
  1) Experience of sexual harassment over the last 3 years, by types of harassment - if no such experiences, go to 5, otherwise go to 2; <br> 
  2) The most recent type of experienced harassment  - Continue with 3;<br> 
  3) The time period of the last harassment - Continue with 4;<br> 
  4) Place of last harassment, by type of location - Continue with 5;<br> 
  5) Experience of physical harassment over the last 3 years, by type of harassment - In case of no such experience, go to the end, otherwise go to 6; <br> 
  6) The most recent type of experienced harassment - Continue with 7;<br> 
  7) Time period of last harassment - Continue with 8;<br> 
  8) Place of the last harassment, by type of location - go to the end.<br> 
  Based on the answers to above questions, the following indicators will be calculated:<br> 
  Sexual harassment prevalence rate: number of persons who experienced at least one form of sexual harassment out of the total number of population included in the survey*100<br> 
  Physical harassment prevalence rate: number of persons who experienced at least one form of physical harassment out of the total number of population included in the survey *100<br> 
  Sexual or physical harassment prevalence rate: number of persons who experienced either a form of sexual harassment or a form of physical harassment out of the total population included in the survey *100. Sexual harassment - physical, verbal or non-verbal behaviour adversely affecting the dignity of person or create an unpleasant, hostile, degrading, humiliating, discriminatory or insulting environment so as to determine the person to undertake sexual intercourses or other unpleasant sexual actions.
