computation_definitions: >-
  Forest -  an element of geographic landscape, functional unit of biosphere,
  composed of forest vegetation community (in which trees and brushes prevail),
  living layers, animals and microorganisms, which are interdependent in their
  biological development and have an influence on their habitat. Areas of at
  least 0.25 ha covered with trees, with the index of tree crown coverage as
  compared to the general surface of the land (consistence) lower than 30%, and
  with mature trees that in normal vegetation conditions can get up to minimum
  heights of 5 m are considered forests<br>  Forest regeneration - process of
  recovery/redressing the forestry vegetation on an empty field. Reforestation -
  recovery of forestry vegetation on deforested fields through cuts or other
  factors (fires, wind broking and crashes, dewatering outbreaks, etc.).
