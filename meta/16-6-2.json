The indicator is based on surveys, which reflect the general perceptions of citizens aged 18 years + based on experiences regarding the availability and quality of services which were effectively provided to survey participants. The respondents are requested to tell about the last experiences in relation to each service and to assess it according to the five \u201ecriteria\u201d or  standards for a certain service: (1) access, (2) accessibility, (3) quality of facilities, (4) equal treatment, (5) attitude of medical personnel (kindness and treatment), quality of teaching from teaching personnel, promptness in provision of public services. The last question is addressed to respondents about their general level of satisfaction with each of the services.<br>  The questions regarding the health, education and public services may be introduced in existing surveys, using the additional elements from these demographic surveys for subsequent disaggregation of results. This method of \u201emodule completion\u201d also allows to cross the levels of satisfactions with other social-economic variables from the wider survey, such as the respondent's health condition. This allows analysing more comprehensively the disparities in service supply and helps to identify the specific factors which influence the level of satisfaction.
