computation_definitions: >-
  Degraded land –  land fields, regardless of their ownership right, which
  through erosion, pollution or destructive actions of some anthropogenic
  factors, have lost for good their agricultural production capacity, but which
  may be improved by reforestation and works for ecosystems' recovery, for the
  purpose of protecting the soil, recovering the hydrological balance and
  improving the environmental conditions. The degraded areas may be part within
  the land cadastre of the following categories: agricultural fields, other
  fields (clough, landslides, etc.), water, etc. The degraded land
  includes:<br>  a) fields with very severe and excessive surface erosion;<br> 
  b) fields with depth erosion – clough, trenches;<br>  c) fields affected by
  active landslides, crashes and cave-ins;<br>  d) sandy fields subject to wind
  or water erosion;<br>  e) salty fields;<br>  f) fields polluted with chemical
  or oil substances;<br>  g) fields covered by open quarry, with mining
  tailings, with production waste or domestic waste, etc.;<br>  h) affected or
  destroyed biota fields;<br>  i) fields with gravel, scree, rocks, torrential
  alluvial deposits;<br>  j) non-productive fields (Government Decision No.1186
  of 28.10.2016 approving the Regulation on performing reforestation works on
  degraded fields under public property of administrative-territorial units and
  degraded fields under private property).
