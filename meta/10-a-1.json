To unify the classification of commodities, the annex of the above-mentioned Convention is used, which includes an universal classification of commodities, currently used by 207 countries of the world as basis for export/import fees, as well as for statistical purposes. Combined classification of commodities is divided into 21 sections, 97 chapters, 1200 tariff items and over 5100 tariff sub-items, which is used as basis for developing and managing the Integrated Customs Tariff of the Republic of Moldova (TARIM). TARIM stores a lot of information regarding the tariff measures and economic policy measures applicable to commodities imported into the Republic of Moldova / exported from the Republic of Moldova. TARIM is published on the official web page of the Customs Service (Law No. 172 dated 25.07.2014 approving the Combined Classification of Commodities).","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"10.a.1.Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff ","source_data_source_1":"1) administrative data - Ministry of Finance <br>  2) [ITC (MAcMap)](http://www.macmap.org)<br>  3) [OMC (BID)](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/daily_update_e/tariff_profiles/MD_E.pdf)<br>  4) [UNCTAD (TRAINS) databases](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/Trade-Analysis/Non-Tariff-Measures/NTMs-trains.aspx)<br>  5) [Databank UNSTATS](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/) <br> ","source_data_supplier_1":"1.Customs Service<br>  2.United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)/World Trade Organization (WTO)","source_organisation_1":"1.Customs Service<br>  2.United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)/ World Trade Organization (WTO)<br> ","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure","source_periodicity_1":"Continuous collection throughout the year","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-07-21: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/bbda7b34a97fb0fa35464e85d6446cbd5cf8796b","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/296b9781b6f7196241f6709581c7e08c480f756a","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-0A-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 564kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"10.a.1","indicator_name":"Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff","indicator_sort_order":"10-aa-01","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/10-a-1/","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"10","target":"Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements","target_id":"10.a","graph_title":"Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff","un_custodian_agency":"ITC,UNCTAD,WTO","un_designated_tier":"1","previous":"10-7-2","next":"10-b-1","page_content":""}}
