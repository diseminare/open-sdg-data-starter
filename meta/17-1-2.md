  According to the global metadata, the exact definition of this indicator is "Proportion of domestic expenses of the Government out of the central budget financed from taxes‚Äù. Central budget of the Government is described in para. 2.81 of [the Government Finance Statistics Manual](https://www.imf.org/external/Pubs/FT/GFS/Manual/2014/gfsfinal.pdf) developed by IMF (GFS) in 2014, and includes the entities of the executive, legislative and judicial powers. This component of public administration is usually covered from the main (or general) budget, the revenues and expenses of which are regulated and supervised by the MF based on the adopted Budget Law. The revenues are defined in chapter 4, para 4.21 of the GFS, and the associated classification is in line with Chapter 5. At their turn, the expenses are defined in Chapter 4 (para. 4.23) of the GFS, and the detailed associated classifications and concepts used for calculating this indicator are mentioned in Chapters 6-8.<br> 
  The data for this indicator are collected annually by the IMF Statistics Department, in Table 1 of the standardised questionnaire. The GFS expenses series are reported through economic expenses from tables 2 and 3 (elements from code 31). Alternatively, for the countries which report total expenses in line with the functional classification (COFOG), from Table GFS 7 a similar calculation of the indicator may be performed.
