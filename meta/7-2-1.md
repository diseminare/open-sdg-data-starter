  Final gross consumption of  energy from renewable sources (ktep) out of the
  final gross consumption of energy (ktep) from all energy sources *100,
  expresses in %<br>
computation_definitions: >-
  Energy from renewable sources represents the energy obtained by harnessing
  renewable unused sources, respectively wind energy, solar energy, aerothermal
  energy, geothermal energy, hydrothermal energy and ocean energy, hydro-power
  energy, biomass, biogas, waste fermentation gas (storage gas) and gas obtained
  from wastewater treatment installations. Final gross consumption of energy -
  energy products supplied for the energy purposes of industry, transportation,
  residential sector, services, including public services, agriculture,
  forestry, fishery, including consumption of electricity and thermal energy
  from electricity and thermal energy producing, as well as technologic
  consumption and losses of electricity and thermal energy in electricity and
  thermal networks.<br>  Final gross consumption of energy from renewable
  sources is calculated as the sum of the following: a) final gross consumption
  of electricity from renewable sources; b) final gross consumption of energy
  from renewables sources for heating and cooling; c) final gross consumption of
  energy from renewable sources in transportation.
