  Area covered with productive and sustainable agriculture out of total agricultural area *100.<br> 
  Numerator covers three dimensions of sustainable production: environmental, economic and social. It covers the agricultural areas of the farms which fulfil the selected sub-indicators for all the three dimensions.<br> 
  Denominator is the area of agricultural area managed by agricultural holdings, defined as amount of agricultural areas used by agricultural holdings which are held (exclusively the ones leased), rented, borrowed, purchased. According to the FAO methodologies, the total agricultural area does not include the fields under the state property and the communal ones used by farms.<br> 
  The calculation of the indicator includes a number of stages:<br> 
  1. Determining the scope of the indicator: the choice for indicator 2.4.1 is to focus on production of crops and growing livestock, excluding forestry, fishing and aquaculture.<br> 
  2. Definition of aspects which should be covered: the choice for indicator 2.4.1 is done to include environment, economic and social aspects in assessing sustainability.<br> 
  3. Choosing a scale for assessing sustainability: the choice of indicator 2.4.1 is performed at the level of the farm, with aggregation at higher levels.<br> 
  4. Selecting the tools for collecting data.<br> 
  5. Selecting subjects from every dimension and selecting a sub-indicator for every subject.<br> 
  6. Assessing the efficiency of sustainability at the farm level for every sub-indicator. To assess the sustainability level of the farm, for every subject, they apply adequate sustainability criteria in line with the corresponding sub-indicators.<br> 
  7. To decide the frequency of indicator monitoring.<br> 
  8 .Modality for reporting the indicator. A set of sub-indicators is presented in the form of a tool dashboard. The tools' bar described above provides an answer regarding the measuring of sustainability at the farm level and aggregated at the national level.<br>

  Sustainable agriculture should support healthy ecosystems and sustainable management of fields, water, and natural resources, ensuring at the same time world food security. To be sustainable, agriculture should meet the needs of the present and future generations for its products and services, ensuring at the same time profitability, environmental health, social and economic justice (FAO definition).<br> 
  The national strategic framework operates with the notion "Ensuring sustainable management of natural resources in agriculture” which includes: 1) use of innovation practices for managing agricultural fields and water by: (i) enhancing the fields and using modern crop practices by rotation of agricultural crops and diversification of agricultural products, (ii) enhancing irrigation services together with access to modern irrigation infrastructure and equipment; 2) applying environment friendly production technologies, ecological products, including biodiversity: use of innovation production technologies for obtaining ecological products, and 3)  existence of support mechanisms for adapting and mitigating the effects of climate changes on agricultural production and agriculture competitiveness. (General Objective 2 from the National Strategy for Agricultural and Rural Development for 2014-2020, approved via the Government Decision No. 409 dated 04.06.2014, approving the National Strategy for Agricultural and Rural Development for 2014-2020)
