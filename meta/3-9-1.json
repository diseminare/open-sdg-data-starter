According to WHO data, the combined effects of ambient air pollution (of air in indoor and outdoor households area) determines over 7 million premature deaths on annual basis. The majority of deaths occur as a cause of strokes, heart diseases, chronic obstructive lung diseases, lung cancer and acute respiratory diseases. The biggest burden is supported by populations of countries with small and medium revenues.","computation_units":"Per 100 000 population","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"3.9.1 Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution ","source_data_source_1":"1) Statistical data on population mortality by causes of death - NPHA <br>  2) Statistical data on population - NBS ","source_data_supplier_1":"1.National Agency for Public Health<br>  2.National Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_1":"National Agency for Public Health","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/c668a137c13a542f480233edcff3476972c2b897","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/296b9781b6f7196241f6709581c7e08c480f756a","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-09-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 216 KB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"3.9.1","indicator_name":"Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution","indicator_sort_order":"03-09-01","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/3-9-1/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"3","target":"By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination","target_id":"3.9","graph_title":"Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution","un_custodian_agency":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","un_designated_tier":"1","previous":"3-8-2","next":"3-9-2","page_content":""}}
