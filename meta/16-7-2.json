To tackle both dimensions of this indicator, two questions are used within the survey/stud. The first question measures the extent to which people believe that they really can express their opinion about what the Government does (inclusive participation in decision-making), and the second question measures the extent to which people feel that the political system allows them to have an influence on policies (focusing on responsive decision-making). The indicator may be produced within the existing household surveys by including the two additional questions, or through separate surveys. The existing surveys to add questions so as to produce the indicator are: Living standard measuring survey (LSMS), Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), Household Budget Survey (HBS), etc.<br> ","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"16.7.2 Proportion of population who believe decision-making is inclusive and responsive","source_data_source_1":"1) Living standard measuring survey (LSMS) - WB, <br>  2) Demography and Health Survey (DHS), <br>  3) Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey  (MICS) - UNICEF, <br>  4) Household Budget Survey (HBS) - NBS;<br>  5) Other surveys ","source_data_supplier_1":"State Chancellery","source_organisation_1":"State Chancellery<br> ","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"State Chancellery","source_periodicity_1":"Once every 2 years","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/c668a137c13a542f480233edcff3476972c2b897","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/296b9781b6f7196241f6709581c7e08c480f756a","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/tierIII-indicators/files/Tier3-16-07-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Tier 3 Work Plan (PDF 77.8 KB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"16.7.2","indicator_name":"Proportion of population who believe decision-making is inclusive and responsive, by sex, age, disability and population group","indicator_sort_order":"16-07-02","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/16-7-2/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"16","target":"Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels","target_id":"16.7","graph_title":"Proportion of population who believe decision-making is inclusive and responsive, by sex, age, disability and population group","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)","un_designated_tier":"3","previous":"16-7-1","next":"16-8-1","page_content":""}}
