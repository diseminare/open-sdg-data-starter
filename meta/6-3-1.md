  Proportion of wastewater sufficiently treated out of all discharged water, %
computation_calculations: >-
  Volume of wastewater safely treated / total volume of collected/discharge wastewater *100.<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  Represents the proportion of wastewater generated by residential sector (households) and by the economic sector which are subject to treatment (off-site/collected through centralised system for wastewater collection), based on treatment stages, in total volume of discharged wastewater. The treatment stages are: primary (includes the physical and/or chemical treatment), secondary (treatment in biological process) and safely. <br> 
  Safely treatment - treatment of water through any process and/or system, which after discharge of wastewater allows the receivers to meet the relevant quality objectives envisaged in the technical norms and water management authorisations in force. <br> 
  Wastewater may be: urban, domestic and industrial.

comparison_global: >-
  As compared to the global indicator, the national indicator includes only the water collected through the centralised collection systems (off-site) and not through the non-centralised system (on-site), the denominator provides only for total collected/discharged wastewater, and not total wastewater.
