  The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
  measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their
  abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level,
  that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as
  biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY
  level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.
