  By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and
  ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water
  scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water
  scarcity

  Proportion of water abstractions from the total water sources available 
  (Water Stress Index)
computation_calculations: >-
  Ratio between the total volume of abstracted water by economy sectors and the
  total water resources *100. Denominator includes: entries + precipitations -
  evapotranspiration - exits of water.<br>
computation_definitions: >-
  Proportion of total volume of abstracted water by economy sectors out of total
  resources of water. <br>  Water abstraction includes primary raw water (which
  was not abstracted before) and fresh water which was abstracted before and
  returned (renewable) to rivers and underground aquifers, such as discharged
  wastewater and agricultural drainage water. Does not include the  Nu include
  the unconventional water, direct use of treated residual water, direct used of
  agricultural drainage water. The total volume of abstracted water is the sum
  of total volume of water abstracted by the corresponding sector minus the
  direct use of wastewater and direct use of agricultural drainage water.<br> 
  Abstracted water: water obtained from aquatic objects located within the
  borders of the Republic of Moldova. Abstracted water is taken from surface
  sources (rivers, lakes), underground sources.
