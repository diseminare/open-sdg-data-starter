  Domestic Material Consumption represents the total value of the flow of
  resources extracted in the country and those imported, with deduction of the
  flows of exported resources, expressed in tones. <br>  Domestic material
  consumption per GDP represents the „productivity of resources” and reflects
  the average level of resources' use in economy, but also a more economical use
  of resources. Entries in average in economy include the extraction of raw
  material (minerals, fuel) another types of natural resources (biomass), and
  exits are perceived as flows from economy towards environment, generally being
  waste and different other emissions.<br>  [See
