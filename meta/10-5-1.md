  [Financial stability](http://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=61404865) is measured through seven indicators which are calculated separately: <br> 
  (1) Rate of own funds of level I out of total assets <br> 
  I0 Own funds in total assets. This rate is calculated using Own Funds (of Level 1) as basis for numerator and total assets as denominator. Data are compiled in line with the guiding lines from Basel I or Basel II, and since II quarter 2018 - according to Basel III.<br> 
  (2) Rate of own funds of level I out of the risk-weighted assets  <br> 
  I2 Own funds of Level 1 as basis for risk-weighted assets. Data for this indicator of Financial Stability are also compiled in line with the guiding lines from Basel I or Basel II, and since the II quarter 2018 - according to Basel III. This measures the sufficiency of banks' capital according to the basic capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). <br> 
  (3) Rate of net non-performing loans as related to the total own funds: <br> 
  I3 Net non-performing loans as related to the total own funds. This indicator of Financial Stability is calculated by taking the value of non-performing loans (NPL) minus the value of discounts calculated for the non-performing loans as numerator and the value of own funds as denominator. The capital is measures as total capital and reserves in the sector balance; for the cross-border consolidated data, may be used as own total capital. This indicator of Financial Stability is one of the capital sufficiency rate, being an important indicator which reflects the capacity of the banking capital to cope with the losses from non-preforming loans.  (4) Share of non-performing loans in the total provided loans: <br> 
  I4 Non-performing loans as related to total gross loans. This indicator is calculated by using the value of non-performing loans as nominator and the total value of loan portfolio (including non-performing loans) as denominator. This indicator is frequently used as a proxy for quality of assets and is meant to identify the problems related to the quality of assets in the loans' portfolio. <br> 
  (5) Return on assets: <br> 
  I6 The return on assets is calculated by dividing the net revenue before the items and extraordinary taxes (according to the FSI Guide recommendations) to the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) for the same period of reference. This indicator of Financial Stability is of bank profitability and is meant to measure use efficiency by the holders of deposits of their assets.<br> 
  (6) Rate of liquid assets as related to the short-term liabilities  <br> 
  I11 Liquid assets as related to short-term liabilities. This indicator is calculated using the basic measure of liquid assets as nominator and the short-term liabilities as denominator. The ratio may be calculated taking as nominator the wide measure of liquid assets. This indicator is a rate of liquid assets as is meant to capture the incompliance of liquidities between assets and liabilities, and offers information about the extent to which the depositors may perform the withdrawal of short-term funds without having problems of liquidities.<br> 
  (7) Rate of net open foreign currency position as related to total own funds <br> 
  I12 The net open foreign currency position as related to own funds. The open foreign currency position calculated based on the BCBS recommendations. Own funds should represent the basic total own funds or own funds of level 1, as the open foreign currency positions is a supervision concept. This indicator is sensible to market risk, which is perceived as reflecting the exposure of depositors to the exchange risk as compared to the capital. It measures the incompliance of assets and liabilities in foreign currency to asses the vulnerability to foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
