  Level of implementation of the normative, strategic and political framework on fishing, fishing fund, and fishery

  The indicator is calculated using three variables with corresponding weight for the final calculation. There were no changes in the calculations and no mixed sources were used.<br> 
  Variable 1: Existence of laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies drafted specially for or meant for the small-scale fishing sector.<br> 
  Variable 2: Implementation of specific initiatives for implementing the SSF Guideline <br> 
  Option 3: Existence of some mechanisms which would allow the small-scale fishers and workers from the fishing sector to participate in decision-taking processes <br> 
  The results are assessed based on the relevant answers from the three questions in the Questionnaire for responsible fishing (CCRF). These questions are transformed into weighted variables for calculating the scores of the country. The objective was to have a positive answer („yes”) to all the sub-variables, resulting in 1 point.<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  The purpose of the indicator is to measure the progress and to provide international comparability in relation to the level of enforcement of the legislative - normative / strategic / political / institutional framework which acknowledges and protects the rights of access to fishing for the small-scale fishing enterprises.
