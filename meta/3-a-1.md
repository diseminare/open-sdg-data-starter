  Prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older
computation_calculations: >-
  Population aged 15 years old and over smoking on daily basis or occasionally out of the total population aged 15 years old and over, multiplied by 100. <br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  Prevalence of tobacco consumption is estimated by WHO based on population surveys carried out at the national level, by taking over the data from the web pages or receiving the databases from the specialised institutions in the country.<br> 
  The estimates made by WHO for prevalence are (i) standardized based on the age so as to improve the international comparability and (ii) are calculated through different methods.<br> 
  The global metadata recommend more sources for calculating this indicator. The most recent data sources available for the RM:<br> 
  1. prevalence of smoking in adults and adolescents - in the MICS/2012 study the information regarding tobacco use (and namely the current use of different tobacco products) were collected among women and men aged 15-49 years old. As well, the study included the question about use of other tobacco products than cigarettes, such as cigars, hooka, cigarillos or pipe - but provided data are not representative.<br> 
  2. prevalence of smoking in adults  - through [the STEPS/2013 study](http://www.who.int/chp/steps) - include the tobacco smokers aged 18-69 years old. The next STEPS study was planned for 2018, which was postponed because of lack of resources.<br> 
  3. prevalence of smoking in adolescents - [Global Youth Tobacco Survey/2013 and 2019](https://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/surveillance/WHO-global-report-trends-prevalence-tobacco-smoking-annex-2.pdf?ua=1), pag.280 -  includes tobacco smokers aged 13-15 years old, including smoking of other types of tobacco use.

  (1) The GLOBAL indicator is standardised by WHO depending on age (relevant for international comparability) and it is calculated through different methods, at the NATIONAL level - it is recommended to use the indicator without standardization
