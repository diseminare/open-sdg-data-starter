computation_definitions: >-
  RM submits annual national reports, which includes questions regarding the
  generation of toxic waste and other waste, as well as imports and exports of
  toxic waste and other waste meant for reuse, recycling, recovery or final
  disposal.<br>  Currently, Form No.1-toxic waste is submitted by economic units
  in whose activity toxic waste is generated, stored, used, and neutralised
  (liquidated). It does not include the import and export of toxic waste. <br> 
  In future, after ensuring the full functionality of the AIS MD system, the
  data source will be changed (Environment Agency) and data will be collected
  also on import/export of toxic waste.<br>  Toxic waste - any waste that has
  one or more toxic characteristics, as specified in Annex 3 of the Law No.
  209/2016 on Waste. The toxic waste includes: HP1 Explosives; HP2 Oxidants; HP3
  Flammable; HP4 „Irritating – skin irritation or eye damage”; HP5 „Toxicity on
  a specific target organ (STOT)/toxicity through aspiration”: HP6 „Acute
  toxicity”; HP7 „Carcinogen”; HP8 „Corrosive”; HP9 „Infectious”; HP10 „Toxic
  for reproduction”; HP11 „Mutagen”; HP12 „Discharge of acute toxicity gas”;
  HP13 „Sensitising substances”; HP14 „Ecotoxic”; HP15 „Waste able to develop
  one of above-mentioned harmful property, which the initial waste does not
  imply directly”.
