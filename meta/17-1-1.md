computation_definitions: >-
  Budgetary revenues are defined according to chapter 4, para. 4.23 of [the Government Finance Statistics Manual](https://www.imf.org/external/Pubs/FT/GFS/Manual/2014/gfsfinal.pdf) developed by the IMF.<br> 
  The budgetary revenues are generated from: a) taxes and fees (GFS code 11); b) state social insurance contribution and compulsory health insurance premiums (GFS code 12); c) grants for supporting the budget and for projects finances from foreign sources (GFS code 13); d) other revenues envisaged by law (GFS code 14).<br> 
  Compulsory transfers and fees are the main revenue sources for the majority of governmental entities. Especially, taxes are mandatory amounts received by governmental entities from institutional entities. Social contributions are real or imputed revenues from the social insurance schemes for ensuring the payment of social insurance benefits. Subsidies are the transfers received by governmental entities from other residential or non-residential governmental units, or international organizations, which do not meet the definition/condition of a fee, subsidy or social contribution. Other revenues include: (i) property income; (ii) sale of goods and services ; (iii) fines, penalties and forfeits; (iv) transfers which are not classified in other parts and (v) premiums, fees and receivables related to life insurance and standardised guarantee schemes.<br> 
  The data for this indicator are collected annually by the IMF Statistics Department, in Table 1 of the standardised questionnaire. Data are submitted in national currency expressed as a proportion of the GDP, where the GDP is derived from the IMF database World Economic Outlook (without applying adjustments and weighting techniques).
