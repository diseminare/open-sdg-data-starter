This risk assessment may follow and may be based on the existing risk assessments, for instance, the ones authorised by FATF.<br>  2) Once the activities generating most of the important flows are identified, they should be estimated in a disaggregated manner. <br>  A first step for building the indicator is to focus it on the IFF types generated in the process of obtaining illicit revenues: this refers to the set of transactions - such as those related to international trade with illicit goods - which either generate directly illicit revenues for a subject during an illicit productive or non-productive activity or which are carried out in the context of illicit production of goods and services.<br>  In this context, the global methodology provided an example for estimating IFF obtained from illegal transportation/trafficking of migrants, which according to the Eurostat Manual on Compiling Statistics regarding illegal economic activities in national accounts and balance of payments, may distinguish four types of smuggling transactions, out of which two generate IFF:<br>  Type I: Resident smugglers and resident migrants do not cover the transnational nature and illegal entry and do no create IFF <br>  Type II: Resident smugglers and non-resident migrants - means export of services and has within IFF:<br>  Export of transport services = number of non-resident migrants transported illegally / trafficked by resident smugglers * prices <br>  Type III: Non-resident smugglers and resident migrants, estimated registered as import of illegal services and represents external IFF:<br>  Import of illegal transport = number of illegally transported/trafficked residents by non-resident smugglers * prices <br>  Type IV: Non-resident smugglers and non-resident migrants - no estimates were registered here<br>  Pilot studies carried out in 5 countries have determined that this methodology is possible, nevertheless there are data limitations, especially in relation to establishing the prices.<br>  At the second step the IFF are estimated in relation to illicit management of revenues. These refer to the IFF generated when the revenues obtained from illegal activities are invested abroad (for instance, in properties). To assess these flows, quantitative and qualitative information may be used, as obtained from financial authorities, central banks, and other entities involved in money laundering and financial offences.<br> ","computation_definitions":"The indicator measures the total value of illicit financial flows entering and exiting the country (IFF) expressed in current USD. IFFs are financial flows which are illicitly generated (for instance, originating from illegal proceed or tax evasion), illicit transfers (such as violation of foreign currency controls) or illicit use (for instance, for terrorism financing).<br> ","computation_units":"Million USD","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"16.4.1 Total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (in current United States dollars) ","source_data_source_1":"1) Balance of payments and the national accounts system reflecting the illegal economic activities <br>  2) Administrative data regarding the trade transactions through Customs, including the ones related to trade wrong invoicing;<br>  3) Statistics on international trade of goods and services <br>  4) Reports on annual questionnaires, which collect data regarding the extent of the drugs' market ","source_data_supplier_1":"1.National Anticorruption Center<br>  2.National Bureau of Statistics<br>  3.National Bank of Moldova<br>  4.State Tax Inspectorate/Ministry of Finance<br>  5.Customs Service/Ministry of Finance<br>  6.Other producers from protection of legal norms field","source_organisation_1":"National Anticorruption Center","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"National Anticorruption Center","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/c668a137c13a542f480233edcff3476972c2b897","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/296b9781b6f7196241f6709581c7e08c480f756a","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-16.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 1361kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"16.4.1","indicator_name":"Total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (in current United States dollars)","indicator_sort_order":"16-04-01","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/16-4-1/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"16","target":"By 2030, significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime","target_id":"16.4","graph_title":"Total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (in current United States dollars)","un_custodian_agency":"UNODC,UNCTAD","un_designated_tier":"3","previous":"16-3-2","next":"16-4-2","page_content":""}}
