The absolute poverty rate represents the amount of monthly expenditures for a set of food products, non-food goods and services considered as minimum necessary amount of a household so as to ensure a decent living.  The absolute poverty rate was established in 2006 by the National Bureau of Statistics according to the methodology (developed jointly by NBS and Ministry of Economy), which implies the annual recalculation of the poverty rate based on the Consumption Price Index. In 2016 the methodology for estimating the absolute poverty indicators was reviewed and the absolute poverty rate was recalculated. In the RM the poverty rate is established only at the national level (but not at the urban or rural levels). Since 2014, the poverty rate is calculated according to the new methodology, approved via the National Bureau of Statistics Order No. 56 dated 24 August 2018.","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"1.2.1 Absolute poverty rate, by sex and age","source_data_source_1":"Household Budget Survey","source_data_supplier_1":"National Bureau of Statistics","source_organisation_1":"National Bureau of Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","previous":"1-1-1","next":"1-2-2","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-04-08: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/fa2095472b7856a0707966fbf00308319e6c4510","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-24: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/35f7bff05763bb5d2d00559e74de8c6f7b4e917a","page_content":"","ro":{"indicator":"1.2.1","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/ro/1-2-1/","sdg_goal":"1","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-02-01.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 98.2 KB)","indicator_definition":"Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas.
