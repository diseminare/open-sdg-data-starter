computation_calculations: >-
  The indicator refers to the status of accreditation and namely:  A, B or C of
  the national human rights institutions.<br>
computation_definitions: >-
  Six models of national human rights institutions exist today in the world
  regions and namely: Commissions for Human Rights, Ombudsman Institutions,
  Hybrid Institutions, Advisory Bodies, Multiple centres and institutions. A
  national human rights institution considered independent is the one that has
  the accreditation status of level A, in line with the Paris Principles. The UN
  Paris Principles (adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly), establishes the
  international standards based on which the national human rights institutions
  (NHRI) may be accredited by the Global Alliance of national human rights
  institutions (GANHR). The accreditation process is carried out through
  peer-to-peer assessment by the Sub-Committee for Accreditation (SCA) of the
  GANHR. There are three possible types of accreditations: <br>  A: in line with
  Paris Principles   <br>  B: Observer Status â€“ not fully in line with Paris
  Principles or no sufficient information was provided so as to allow an
  assessment  <br>  C: Not in line with Paris Principles. <br>  Data are
  collected annually by the Sub-Committee for Accreditation (SCA) of GANHR from
  the National Ombudsman Offices.<br>  Since May 2018, the Republic of Moldova
  Ombudsman Office acquired the accreditation status of level A.<br>
