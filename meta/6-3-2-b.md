  6.3.2.b. Proportion of underground water bodies which achieved the "good quality" class according to the microbiological parameters
computation_calculations: >-
  Number of underground water bodies classified as being of "good quality" status out of the total number of classified underground water bodies *100
computation_definitions: >-
  National legislation defines the following notions regarding the water bodies: 1) artificial water body – surface water body created for human activity; 2) surface water body  – distinct and significant part of a surface water, such as: lake, reservoir, pond, water course – river or canal, segment of a water course  – river or canal, transitory water; 3) underground water body – distinct volume of underground water within the limits of an aquifer or a number of aquifers.<br> 
   Quality requirements for underground water are set in Annex No. of the GD no. 931/2013 approving the Regulation on quality requirements for underground water.
