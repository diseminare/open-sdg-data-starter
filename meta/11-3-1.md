  The indicator assesses the degree of territorial extension of cities as related to the degree or urbanisation. This indicator needs defining two components: 1) land consumption rate and 2) population growth rate. The calculation of the population growth rate is easier and more available, while the rate of land consumption is a challenge and it needs to use new techniques. When estimating the land consumption rate, it is important to clearly define what land "consumption" means, because this may cover "consumed" or "preserved" or available for "development" aspects for such cases as land covered with wet zones. Secondly, there is no unequivocal measure for the land if the land under development is really "newly-developed" (or free) or if it is at least partially „redeveloped“. Hence, the percentage out of the total real urban area which was really newly developed (consumed) will be used as a measure of the land consumption rate. The completely developed area is also sometimes called built area.<br>
