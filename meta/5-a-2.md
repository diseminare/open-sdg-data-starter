  The indicator „measures” the extent to which the normative framework of the country guarantees women's rights over land, this being assessed through 6 proxy indicators extracted from international law and accepted best international practices, especially the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGT), approved unanimously in 2012 by the members of the Committee for Food Security (CFS).<br> 
  The 6 proxy indicators measuring the indicator 5.a.2 are the following:<br> 
  1. Common registration of land on compulsory basis or through economic incentives;<br> 
  2. Spouse's mandatory approval for land-related transactions;<br> 
  3. Women's and girls' equal right to succession;<br> 
  4. Allocation of financial resources for extending women's property and control over land;<br> 
  5. In the legal system recognising the ordinary property over land, there is clear protection of women's rights over land <br> 
  6. Compulsory quota for women's participation in administration and management of land <br>
