  Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of a functional road
computation_calculations: >-
  Known as Rural Access Index  RAI = share of population living within 2 km from the closest road in "good or acceptable shape" in rural areas. <br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  "Good or acceptable" roads mean:<br> 
  i) paved road with IRI (International Road Index) smaller than 6 meters / km and unpaved road with IRI smaller than 13 meters / km, when IRI data are available <br> 
  ii) paved road in excellent, good or acceptable condition and non-asphalted road in excellent or good condition, when IRI data are not available, but other data about road condition are available, such as PCI or visual assessment by class.<br> 
  National roads – roads which are public property of the state, ensuring the main international road links, the links between the capital city and the residence cities, municipalities and objectives of republican importance, as well as the links between them.<br> 
  Local roads include: a) roads of rayon (municipality) interest  – ensuring the link between the residence cities and villages (communes) from the composition of the rayon (municipality), as well as the link between villages (communes), including access to them from the national roads.  b) commune roads – which ensure the link between the residence village of the commune and the component villages or among them and the objectives of commune interest; c) streets – public roads within localities which are public property of administrative-territorial units at the first level or of Chisinau and Balti municipalities.<br> 
  According to the Roads Law  (509), art. 2, para.(5) depending on the type of the road structure, the roads are divided in: a) roads with capital (permanent) road structure  – with cement concrete or asphaltic concrete paving; b) roads with light (semi permanent) road structure – with road paving made of local grading material with bituminous binders; c) roads with temporary road structure – stoned roads.<br> 
  According to NBS, the roads with rigid paving include the modernised and stone roads. The modernised roads are the ones with the carriageway covered with one  of the following categories of paving: concrete-cement, asphalt, paving from carved stone and with hydro-carbon binders. The stoned roads are the ones with the carriageway of one of the following constructions: paving of raw stone or blocks, simple stoning or improved ones. Soil roads - (unpaved) are considered the roads with stabilised basis, not covered with crushed stone, bituminous agents or asphalt binders, cement or stoned pavement.
