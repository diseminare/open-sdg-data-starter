  The methodology for calculating this indicator is presented within an extended table (called „Calculation Sheet for PFM Performance Indicators PI-1 and PI-2 (i)” ) on [the PEFA web page](http://www.pefa.org/sites/default/files/En-PI-1%20%26%20PI-2%20Exp%20calculation-Jan%202015.xls). As well, this is described in detail in the second part of the document ["Public Finance Management Evaluation Framework”](https://pefa.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/PEFA%20Framework_English_Web_Dec18_Second%20Edition.pdf).<br> 
  The essence of the indicator is the score. The country is assessed separately on a ordinal scale in four points: A, B, C or D, in line with exact criteria:<br> 
  (A) Total expenditures varied from 95% to 105% of the total budgetary expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.<br> 
  (B) Total expenditures varied from 90% to 110% of the total budgetary expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.<br> 
  (C) Cumulative expenditures varied from 85% to 115% of total budgetary expenditures approved for at least two of the last three years.<br> 
  (D) Productivity is lower than the one which is necessary for C degree.<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  This indicator measures the degree in which the result of cumulated budgetary expenditures reflects the initially approved amount, as it was defined in the documentation on the state budget and fiscal reports. The coverage is the consolidated state budget and the covered time period is the last three finished fiscal years. The indicator attempts to reflect the reliability of the state budget. The cumulated expenditures include the real expenditures which cover the expenditures incurred as a result of some unplanned or exceptional events  - for instance, armed conflicts or natural disasters. Expenditures financed through unexpected revenues, including through privatisation, should be included and recorded in fiscal tables and in narrative support. Expenditures financed externally through loans or subventions should be included, if they are covered by the budget, together with the emergency vote and loan interest rates. Expenditures allocated to waiting accounts are not included in total. Nevertheless, if the amounts are held in suspension accounts at the end of every year, which could affect the scores if included in the calculation, they can be included. In such cases, the reasons for inclusion should be clearly indicated.<br> 
  Actual expenditures may deviate from the initially approved budget due to reasons independent from accuracy of previsions - for instance, as a result of a major macro-economic shock. The calibration of this indicator supports an unusual or "exceeded" year and focuses on deviations from previsions, which appear on two out of the three years which are subject to evaluation.
