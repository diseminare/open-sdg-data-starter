  Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all
computation_calculations: >-
  Built-up area of cities that is open space for public use  = Total area of open space for public + Total area of land allocated for streets / Total area of built-up surfaces of urban localities  * 100. <br> 
  Method for estimating the public space area is based on three stages: <br> 
  a) spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area of cities - to delimit the built-up areas of urban localities/agglomerations and to calculate their total surface (square kilometres). Maps will be generated on land use and inventories will be made through works in the field so as to identify public areas. <br> 
  b) estimation of total area of the open space for public - the total area of open space for public will be mapped and calculated within the urban limits, defines based on the built-up areas of the cities. The inventory of the open space for public will be digitalised and vectorised using the GIS software so as to allow calculating the areas. The total area of the open space for public will be proportionate to the total built-up area of the city so as to obtain the share of open spaces allocated for public.<br> 
  c) estimation of the total area allocated for streets, the land related to the street networks from the built-up area of the locality, and borders are determined as an integral immovable property, for each street separately (identified by the name of the street), within the limits of a cadastre sector <br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  Built-up area is defined as the area occupied by buildings and other constructions.<br> 
  Open urbanised space refers mainly to the unequipped area, including the open areas, forests, cultural land, parks, unequipped urban areas, ecological fields.<br> 
  Public spaces are considered to be all the places which are held publicly or are of public use, accessible and pleasant to all, free of charge and without profit, classified in streets, open spaces and public facilities. Open space for public includes: parks, recreation areas (inc. playgrounds, rivers, riparian area, public beach, etc.), public gardens, markets/squares and alleys.<br> 
  Legal basis: Law no. 29 (5.04.18) on Delimitation of Public Properties, Regulation on the way to delimit public immovable property assets (GD no. 63 (11.02.19))<br> 
  if  urban extent to be captured would consist of all the buildings and the small open space areas (<200 ha) that are surrounded by buildings and the open space fringe that is within 100 meters of urban and suburban areas (i.e. where built up area is more than 25%)

  The national indicator is described per general according to the metadata of the global indicator.<br> 
  The national indicator will be reviewed after finalizing the process of delimiting the public property areas into public property fields of the state and public property fields of administrative - territorial units, including into fields of public or private domain. <br>
