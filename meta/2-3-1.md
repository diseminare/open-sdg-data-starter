  FAO suggest defining the small producers of food supply as producers that:<br> 
  1) operate with a size of land plots that fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) from the cumulated distribution of the size of land plots at the national level (measured in hectares); and<br> 
  2) operate with a number of animals which fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) of the cumulated distribution of the number of animals per production unit at the national level (measured in livestock units); and<br> 
  3) obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities which fits the first two quintiles (under 40%) out of the cumulated distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at the national level (measured in purchasing power parity in USD), which does not exceed the amount of 34,387 USD at PPP .<br> 
  As the indicator refers to a set of production units - the small scale ones - the denominator should include the information about the entire production undertaken in every unit. Hence it is necessary for the production volumes to be reported in a common number, taking into account that it is impossible to refer to physical units. The most convenient number for aggregating the products from the denominator is a vector of constant prices. When measured at different moments in time, as it is requested for monitoring the SDG indicators, the change of constant values represents change in aggregated volume.
